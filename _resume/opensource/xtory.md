#### A tool for writing branching nonlinear stories.

A small web app written in **JS ECMAScript5** created for writing
nonlinear stories using node graph editing and you can use it for
writing both Story and Conversations, Supporting variables, and function
calls inside of the engine at specific points of the story.

It can convert conversations to lightweight **JSON** for use
in your game engine. This app also comes with a built-in **Localization** tool.
