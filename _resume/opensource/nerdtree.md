#### A tree explorer plugin for vim. 

The NERDTree is a file system explorer for the Vim editor. Using this plugin, users can visually browse complex directory hierarchies, quickly open files for reading or editing, and perform basic file system operations.

I'm currently the sole maintainer of this project, Although it is in a stable state and doesn't need much attention.
