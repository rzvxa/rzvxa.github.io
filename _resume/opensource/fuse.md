#### The Fuse Programming Language.

It is a __staticly typed__, __garbage collected__ language with a similar syntax to __Lua__, __Rust__, __TypeScript__ and __Haskell__.

Fuse code can transpile and target runtimes such as Lua 5.1 to 5.4, LuaJit, and Luau. The language itself is written in __Rust__ and its focus is on extendability and performance. It comes with a compiler, parser, linter, formatter, testing suit, LSP, and package manager.
