title: Unity MVVM Framework
---
#### A way of making Unity UI more organized

This framework provides you with a __reactive__ way of making UIs using
__UniRx__, and you can use this to separate Logic and UI from
each other.

This way you can have your logic written in normal __C#__ code and
This gives you the ability to easily write __Test Cases__ and
reusing logic on the server side for __Input validation__ and
__Anti cheat strategies__.

This framework is 100% __async__ and it comes with __Dependency Injection__,
__Message Broker__, __Dialogue Service__, __Navigation Service__
for moving between scenes, __Reactive Binding__ including __One-way binding__,
__Two-way binding__, __Event binding__, __Visibility binding__
and __Collection binding__ which you can use __converters__
to convert Input/Output values, and all of this is done in the editor
without any code.

It's have __Binding Debugger__ for debugging all these reactive
binds in edit mode or playing.


It also has a __Localization Service__ supporting both __JSON__
and __CSV__ files as a translation table.
