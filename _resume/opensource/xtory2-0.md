title: Xtory 2.0
---
#### A tool for writing branching nonlinear stories. But this time with plugins

This project started as simply wrapping __Xtory 1.0__ in an __electron__ layer,
For creating an out-of-the-box application experience, But after many purging
and restarting the project, I've settled down on an __electron__ app using __ReactJS__ written
in __TypeScript__ This reincarnation of __Xtory__ contains a plugin system for
adding custom code to the application itself, For new Flows, Engine Integration, Custom Outputs
and anything else that is needed for your pipeline.
