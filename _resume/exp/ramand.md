#### Senior Unity Developer +Technical Director

They had an idea about a soccer-based game, it was a top-down strategic soccer
game and it was fun to work on, we did 6 months of prototyping and
testing different mechanics and controls there, I also wrote a node
based project configuration manager and bootstrap code generator
called __Blocco__ sadly it's a closed-source project.
I did lots of __Shaders__ for the Saychin game including a shader
capable of doing lightweight
__subsurface scattering__, __cavity__, __triplanar texture mapping__,
very efficient
__Light cap__ implementation based on zBrush algorithms. and did
Some maintenance work on Soccer champion, Implemented __Asset bundles__ 
for their projects and other things.
