#### Lead Software Engineer

IHP was a contract work company, we did lots of projects together and I actually
don't know what happened to them because it's all was for clients,
We worked on one game called Wits & Wagers it was a board game we
did, we also did 2 Idle games one called "shir abaad" and the other
One is "Ragbar", I also worked a little on their in-house game called
"Battle shoot"!
