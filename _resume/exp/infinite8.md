#### Technical Lead

__Infinite8__ is an awesome place to work,
especially the Naxia team which to me felt like home,
I've worked here on a wide range of problems,
From fast prototyping to pipeline tool development,
Both on the server and client side, Working together with other teams 
towards creating a uniform experience in the whole development cycle of our projects. We also had to switch to
__WebGL__ because we wanted to take full advantage of a web interface with all of its glory for user interactions,
This way users could have a conventional user interface for interacting with the game, With beautiful 3D-rendered scenes integrated into it
And all of this from the comfort of their web browser.
This resulted in creating an architecture with embedded __WebGL__ inside of our __React__ front-end, Both talking to
our __Cluster__ of __Micro-Services__.
Over at __Infinite8__ we focused on tackling many problems with __Web3__ and __Play To Earn__ model in general.
The __SpeedFreaks__ game is our finest attempt to bring engaging __NFT__ games with procedural 3D content, We tried our best
to create a self-sustaining __Economy__ with a functional positive loop growing its transactions organically.
Right now __SpeedFreaks__ project is in good hands, As the team over there landed a direct partnership with __SplinterLands__, And I'm excited for what is next for the great people working over there at __Infinite8__
