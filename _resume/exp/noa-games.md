#### Senior Software Engineer

I have worked on many of their projects and upcoming titles. Originally I hired
there to work on their new title ProFC, This project has 3 parts,
__CakePHP__ back-end, __C#__ __unity__ Client and __C++__              game server. I did all 3 of them, for ProFC I wrote a 
cool tool for debugging __C++__, and __PHP__ from __Unity Editor__              and using __PHP xdebug__ and __C++ GDB__. Then they moved me
for some maintenance work on the Shadow Racer client and its back-end
which was also written in __PHP__ and used __CakePHP__ MVC
framework. I also did some work on their casual game Vaneti!
