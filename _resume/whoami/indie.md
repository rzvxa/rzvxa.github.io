title: Going Indie
---
#### I've always wanted to be a giant space crab.

I love both the art and programming aspects of games;
This is actually why I'm trying to go full __Indie__,
The indie scene is great for experimenting and working on new mechanics.
Right now I'm excited about working on __STG__ games as everyone knows,
This genre is __stale__ currently, So it seems like a good place for
experimenting with new gameplay mechanics.
