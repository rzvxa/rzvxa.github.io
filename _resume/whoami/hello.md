#### My name is Ali Rezvani and I'm not your average Software engineer.
###### Proceeds to describe the most generic back story!

I started as a game developer but after a few years I began to write highly optimized back-ends in __Rust__, __C#__ and __NodeJS__

I found programming interesting at the age of 14 with __VB6__ but soon enough I dropped that language in favor of using __C++__, since then it's been true love between me and __C__ style programming languages except for __python__ I guess! I like to do new things, learn new frameworks every day, and simply improve my craft.

All of my work experiences are not included on my LinkedIn, but anyway, I'd love to have you check that out.
